## Introduction 
The first idea for the project was to recreate the architecture of OpenAI Wisper model from the paper <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf" target="_blank">Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision<a> and train it from scratch on a the english Librispeech dataset to evaluate its performance. Something went wrong with this part so we decided to change the approach. Everything about this part can be found in the [from_scratch](from_scratch) directory.
